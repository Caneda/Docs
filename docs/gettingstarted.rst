Circuit Examples
----------------
There is a repository hosted at `Example Circuits <https://github.com/Caneda/Examples>`_ which contains example circuits for Caneda, ready to use. The example circuits are continuously updated and improved, and periodically new circuits are added.

To try any circuit, simply download the selected schematic to your machine and open it using Caneda. All circuits are ready for simulation using Caneda's tools. Inside each schematic there are specific details to the circuit, where applicable.

As an alternative you can download the whole repository and save it in any local folder to have as a reference.
